## AI text generation policy

Using LLM-based generative AI tools like ChatGPT can enhance your writing by refining language and structure. However, the knowledge, ideas, and reasoning in your proposal must originate from _you_. AI serves as a support tool, not a substitute for human creativity. Proposals generated entirely by AI will not be considered. We value your originality and problem understanding. Any proposal submitted using AI tools should clearly indicate what part is your work and what part was enhanced or generated by AI.
